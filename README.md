Register for Twilio for free at "https://www.twilio.com/en-us"
Extract the zip file "CADNS-main"
Ensure that there is an internet connection
Create a python source_file named "twilio_numbers" the python source file should contain # account_sid = 'xxxxx' auth_token = 'xxxxx' twilio_number = 'xxxxx' target_number = 'xxxxx'# replace xxxxx with the information from twilio
Open jupyter Notebook, locate the file "MAIN_MAIN" and open it then run the python script
Open the folder "Car_Accident_Detection_And_Notification_System_code" and open the file "Car_Accident_Detection_And_Notification_System_code" with the Arduino IDE
Run and compile the code in the Arduino IDE and copy the Hex file location from the arduino terminal
Open the file "" then right click the Arduino UNO micro controller click properties and paste the hex file location in the path
Run the simulation in proteus
Adjust the sensors to trigger an accident(the sensor thresholds are wriiten in the arduino code)
